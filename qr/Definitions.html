<b>actor</b> - an entity identifiable by an observer as a cause of an effect; an entity that performs [a part]; an entity that participates in a process or representation as in a pre-specified script.  The general sense is that of an observer identifying an entity that acts or causes things to happen.  Technically, such an entity is an OO object with the ability to schedule its own actions.  The Actor Model of Computation uses this term in a more specific sense. 
<br />
<b>agent</b> - an actor playing a role or acting on behalf of something else. 
<br />
<b>closure</b> - the binding of unbound (free) variables in the lexical environment. In computer science, it refers to a function closed over its unbound variables. 
<br />
<b>schematic</b> - containing placeholder elements that represent any number of objects that can be substituted for the placeholder or each other.  E.g. enzymes exhibiting linkage specificity are schematic. 
<br />
<b>schematic relations</b> (aka schema for constituents) - bundles of couplings, relations, between placeholders, where any member of a set of equivalent objects can occupy that place. 
<br />
<b>schematic constituents</b> (aka schema for relations) - an object whose relational requirements (inputs, outputs, and controls) can be satisfied by any member or subset of a set of equivalent relations.
