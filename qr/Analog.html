<p><b>Analog</b></p>
<p>We require methods that enable us to move beyond mathematical descriptions of conceptualized mechanisms to more concrete (real, extant) mechanisms.  ISL components are concrete.  To achieve validation targets, events occurring during execution must be analogous to events believed to occur in vitro.  To emphasize those points and distinguish models like the ISL from conventional models, we identify the ISL and methodologically similar models as in silico analogs.  
What are the differences between mechanisms represented in mechanistic or mechanism-based ODE models and mechanisms concretely instantiated in an analog?  Mechanism-based ODE model utilize a description of a plausible biomimetic mechanism.  The ISL utilizes an actual mechanism that is biomimetic.  An equation-based model that is mechanistic in what it describes can only be measured in the same sense as its state variables.   The ISL, which itself is biomimetic, can be measured in several ways and (importantly) it can be measured in ways similar to how its referent is measured.  
</p><p>
Can we test mechanistic hypotheses using either method?  No.  A mechanism-based ODE model is arrived at inductively and implemented deductively.  The actual mechanism is in the referent.  To challenge the induced mechanistic hypothesis, one needs to undertake a wet-lab experiment.  An analog is an instantiated mechanistic hypothesis.  When parameterized and executed, it either will or will not achieve its prespecified similarity criterion.
