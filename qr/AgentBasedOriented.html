<p><b>Agent-Based & Agent Oriented</b></p>
<p>Pervasive uncertainty, sparse system information, and considerable variability make distinguishing causes from effects difficult.  Agent-based methods provide the flexibility, extensibility, and generality needed to assemble software analog mechanisms that become increasingly biomimetic during execution.  A liver lobule and the ISL analog are similarly compartmentalized.

Many biological processes are analogized as logical statements; for instance, if protein A binds to protein B; then protein B is activated.  Our agents implement similar rule-based behavior when mediating interacting components.  
</p><p>
A goal of these experiments is that ISL measurements made at different spatial and temporal scales during the same simulation can be mapped separately and quantitatively to wet-lab measurements also spanning different spatial and temporal scales.  Achieving that goal requires relational grounding throughout the analog.  Consequently, specific mapping models are expected to vary.  For more information see <a href="http://www.tbiomed.com/content/8/1/35">http://www.tbiomed.com/content/8/1/35</a>.

The variety of analog-to-wet-lab mappings (i.e. the comparison of analog to referent attributes) is a direct measure of an analog's multiscaleness.  A mapping has a spatial and temporal scale.  Biological spatial scales typically correspond to functional "levels" being observed.  A wet-lab experiment's temporal scales typically correspond to sets of measurements at intervals.  Likewise, the state of different analog components (often at different spatial scales) updates at different time steps/simulation cycles.
