<p><b>Time of Death</b></p>
<p>
The time axis for Death events is scaled to map directly to wet-lab clock time.
</p><p> 
To reduce simulation time, we made Death events occur a factor of 4 sooner and over a correspondingly scaled interval.  
</p><p> 
Thus, for these simulations, current cycleLimit = 21600 s = 6 h, and Death events occur from between approx. 1-3 h after being triggered.
