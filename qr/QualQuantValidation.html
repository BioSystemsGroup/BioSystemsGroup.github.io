<p><b>Qualitative to Quantitative Validation</b></p>
<p>Qualitative must precede quantitative validation.  Using discrete event simulations facilitates staging that transition.  Qualitative validation targets are primarily relative sequences of events.  Requiring particular sequence timings makes those validation targets temporally quantitative.  The latter can be achieved using relatively coarse grain, parsimonious analogs.  Wet-lab measurements made at different temporal and spatial granularities are always proportional.  However, mappings from coarse and finer grain analog phenomena to wet-lab counterparts need not be proportional.
