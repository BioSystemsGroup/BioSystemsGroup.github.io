<p><b>Monte Carlo Sampling</b></p>
<p>Results from Monte Carlo sampling (including spatial architecture) to maps to sources of variability and uncertainty.  One sample = one Monte Carlo Lobule.  We mimic uncertainties associated with probabilistic biological events by using probabilistic parameters that change each simulation cycle.  In addition, some probabilistic parameters are not scalar but vary over space.  During analog execution, agent-mediated Monte Carlo sampling of probability distributions over space and time determine the location and timing of injury and repair phenomena.
