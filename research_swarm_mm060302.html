She proposed a single class for the cells with three subclasses (normal, static, and dead) where the subclasses interact with each other.  Cindy advised us to start with the normal cells only and add in the static and dead cells later once the program is up and running.  When Li and Amy H. asked if that would entail reworking the entire program, Cindy responded that object-oriented programming is designed to allow the addition (and removal) of classes.  She then spent some time talking about the heatbug program, and then, having convinced the others that we should begin with the normal subclass of cells only, explained the structure of object-oriented programming using a Swarm tutorial page as a guide.</p><p>Cindy asked what properties we wanted the cells to have, and we agreed that the cells should divide if there’s enough room but not if the tumor itself is too large.  Amy H. wanted to be sure that the cells would divide in a way such that the tumor remained somewhat spherical (as opposed to dividing down a line), and we discussed the grid structure of Swarm.  We thought about considering growth in one-dimension initially and adding the second dimension later, but we believed that such an approach would be difficult to implement.</p><p>The idea of using a fixed oxygen gradient was brought up, and we elected to create a class for the environment where we artificially fixed oxygen levels.  The goal is for the environment and the tumor to interact with each other in later versions.  Cindy recommended that we choose the properties of the cell class and that we split up the work.  We determined that the cells should check for available space in four directions (up, down, left, and right, and not in diagonal directions).  If space was available, the cell would divide.  If more than one space was available, the cell would randomly choose one so that it became unlikely that the tumor would grow in a straight line.  The tasks were then divided so that Li and Amy H. would create the classes for the cells and the environment and Cindy would integrate them.</p>				<img src="images/clear.gif" width="514" height="1" border="0">			</td>			<td class="news" width="237" height="100%">				<div id="right_box" class="right-box">					<div class="right-corner">&nbsp;</div>					<div class="right-top">&nbsp;</div>					<div class="right-content">						<p class="news-link" id="top-news"><a href="http://www.site.uottawa.ca/~oren/conf-org/ADS_2010/ADS-CFP.htm" target="new">ADS 2010:<br/>A meeting of interest</a></p>						<p class="sample">The premise of the agent paradigm, its related theory and						methodologies together with advances in multilevel modeling of complex						systems of interactions opened new frontiers for advancing the physical,						natural, social, military, and information sciences and engineering...</p>					</div>				</div>				<img src="images/clear.gif" width="237" height="1" border="0">			</td>		</tr>	</table></body></html>
