                                discover useful new biological knowledge. We seek novel

                                a goal for each of us is to generate new knowledge that
                                can be translated into either real, tangible improvements
                                in healthcare or into the drug discovery and development.</p>

                                Because biological organisms are uniquely adaptable, no one model
                                will ever be able to represent more than a tiny subset
                                of a biological systems full range of behaviors.To
                                more realistically simulate these systems we need a new
